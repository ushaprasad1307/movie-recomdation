# movie-recomdation
Final project for the Building AI course
## Summary
A Web Base user-item Movie Recommendation Engine using Collaborative Filtering By matrix factorizations algorithm and The recommendation based on the underlying idea that is if two persons both liked certian common movies,then the movies that one person has liked that the other person has not yet watched can be recommended to him.

## Background
A Web Base user-item Movie Recommendation Engine using Collaborative Filtering By matrix factorizations algorithm and The recommendation based on the underlying idea that is if two persons both liked certian common movies,then the movies that one person has liked that the other person has not yet watched can be recommended to him.
## How It is used?
The functionality will be directly included in the tool/webapp we already have and are using internally, so all our users who are already using it (and future ones) will (hopefully) benefit from this project.

For obvious reasons I won't be able to provide the data used in this repo, but I will try to include some anonymized sample data, and the scripts to train and use the model.
## Data sources and AI methods
Data is available in an existing database, and is continously filled with new data from users.
I will use some sort of item-item recommendation system, not sure about the details yet, I still have some reading and experimenation ahead of me on that topic.
## Challenges
Even if there already is quite some data, it might not be enough to create good recommendations.

Another problem might be that not so common items will become hidden from users, which I will have to find ways to remedy.

## What next?
Too early to say really, as I'm not yet even sure this will work as intended.
